[![Chidozie's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=codingwithcn&show_icons=true&theme=dark)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

  My name is Chidozie N. But I go by codingwithcn on all my programing user account. I am a highschooler who loves to code
  
  __Projects I am proud of__:
  -
  - __Lifters International__ - A startup that hopes to bridge the gap between gym and tech. We are SaaS based business that allows fitness enthusiast to connect and match with one another. We also allow them to track their daily micronutrient, while giving them access to our food database. Not only that but we provide ad services for business/companies in the fitness industry to be able to reach the right user for them, while also providing our food api services to businesses/developers. Lastly but not least, without our recent update fitness trainers can now have a source of income with us, allowing them to post workout video in turn for getting clients that will pay them through us.
  
  - __InvestIt__ - An investing game, that allows you to make your own servers and allow players/friends to connect to your local servers so you could play the game with them. You can either make your own Company or invest in others.


  - __NnajiGAI__ - Stands for Nnaji Google Ai. It was suppose to use google gmail system to access emails from a gmail account, and then process the email before sending a reply back. But unfortunately I was not able to access my google account so I had to use ICloud, was to lazy to come up with a new name, so I kept NnajiGAI. The real purpose was to create groccery reminders for my family members, telling them about finished items, so they will know what they will need to get next time they go shopping.


  - __CodeAnyWhere__ - This project was meant to create a server on your computer using flask framework. Allowing you to access and make changes to your computer files and folders from where-ever you are. The program runs on a local network. But if you would like to make it accessible anyway you would need to open your ip address to allow incoming connections
