### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 
  My name is Chidozie N. But I go by codingwithcn on all my programing user account. I am a highschooler who loves to code
  
  __Projects I am proud of__:
  -
  - __InvestIt__ - An investing game, that allows you to make your own servers and allow players/friends to connect to your local servers so you could play the game with them. You can either make your own Company or invest in others.


  - __NnajiGAI__ - Stands for Nnaji Google Ai. It was suppose to use google gmail system to access emails from a gmail account, and then process the email before sending a reply back. But unfortunately I was not able to access my google account so I had to use ICloud, was to lazy to come up with a new name, so I kept NnajiGAI. The real purpose was to create groccery reminders for my family members, telling them about finished items, so they will know what they will need to get next time they go shopping.


  - __CodeAnyWhere__ - This project was meant to create a server on your computer using flask framework. Allowing you to access and make changes to your computer files and folders from where-ever you are. The program runs on a local network. But if you would like to make it accessible anyway you would need to open your ip address to allow incoming connections
  
  __Projects I am currently working on__:
  -
  - __Captalist__ - A free to play web-based game that allows player to take up the role of citizens, politcians, investors and etc; in the country/state/city of their choosen. This game is currently still in development, and most likely will be until summer of 2022 which is when I plan on releasing the first version of the game


  - __Myself__ - I am the biggest project of all. Trying to constantly improve, in the thing that I love doing, whether that is playing sports or learning new programming languages and gaining new programming skills. Because constant improvement is the only way I see myself getting far in life
